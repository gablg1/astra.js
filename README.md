# Astra.js

A fullstack React framework that blurs the lines between frontend and backend development.

- Call server side functions as if they were in the client
-- Astra leverages the full power of type safe serialization powered by Typescript.
- Everything you need
-- Astra is a full stack framework that ships with everything you need to build your app - frontend and backend. User
auth, routes, databases, asynchronous job queue, you name it. Astra chooses a set of reasonable defaults that work well together so you don't have to.
- Optimized for happiness
-- The #1 principle behind all of Astra's design choices is developer happiness and speed.
- Think "Ruby on Rails" for the React + Typescript age.
